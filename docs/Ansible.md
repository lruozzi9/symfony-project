[Return to Summary main page](README.md)

Tutorial to configure your local/staging/production servers to run application.

To run Ansible, you can choose between two ways: local installation, the simplest but if you have other projects with other Ansible versions you can encounter some problems; Docker installation, the hardest, but you have everything out of your local machine.
